# Bedrock Token Usage Statistics Calculator

This CLI tool helps to visualize foundation model (FM) usage in [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/). It aggregates the FM usage across Bedrock application inference profiles and provides visibility on current usage gap towards the service quotas (e.g. tokens-per-minute/TPM and requests-per-minute/RPM)

While [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) already provides metrics for the FMss used in Bedrock, it might not be straightforward to aggregate usage for that FM when used across multiple custom application inference profiles. Also, the quota lookup needs to be done separately via [AWS service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html). With this tool, you can specify the region and model to analyze and it will fetch the usage across last 1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, 14 days, and 30 days, each with aggregated data across the application inference profiles. It will generate HTML report containing the statistics table and time series data.

This CLI tool can be used to answer questions like:
1. What is the TPM, and RPM of a particular FM in Bedrock in certain region, across all of my application inference profiles?
2. How does each inference profile contribute to that RPM usage?
3. Which projects use the most of TPM for certain model? (provided that you tag the application inference profile appropriately)
4. When did the throttling occur for certain model and which project or application inference profile caused that?
5. How far is my current TPM against the quota?

This tool works by calling AWS APIs from your local machine, including CloudWatch [Get Metric Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html) and Bedrock [List Inference Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_ListInferenceProfiles.html). It then generates a JSON and HTML output file per model/system inference profile being analyzed inside `results` folder. The tool uses metadata files in `metadata` folder to obtain the list of available regions and FMs and to map each FM into the AWS service quotas L code (L-xxx). 

You can refresh the available regions, the available foundation models, and the service quotas mapping for the FMs using the scripts in `scripts` folder. The FM to service quotas mapping is done intelligently with the help of foundation model called through Bedrock.

## ⚠️ **Important Disclaimer**

**This is sample code provided for educational and demonstration purposes only.** Before using this tool in any production or critical environment, you are strongly advised to review all code thoroughly and evaluate it against best practices, security and compliance standards, and other requirements.

- **Time series charts**: Graphs for each time period that displays usage across application inference profiles for that model
- **Percentile statistics**: p50, p90, and average values in tables
- **Multiple metrics**: TPM, RPM, TPD (tokens-per-day), invocations, invocation throttles, input token count, output token count, and invocation latency.

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required Software
- **Python** >= 3.9 with [venv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
- **AWS CLI** configured with appropriate credentials
- **GIT** to clone this repository (not needed if you download manually into .zip)

### AWS Account Requirements
- **Bedrock Access**: Enabled foundation models in your AWS account
- **IAM Permissions**: See detailed permission requirements below

### Network Requirements
- **Internet Access**: For accessing AWS APIs

### IAM Permissions

This tool requires different IAM permissions depending on which features you use:

#### Option 1: Usage Analysis Only (Lightweight)

**Use this if:** You only run `./analyze-bedrock-usage.sh` to analyze token usage.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "BedrockUsageAnalysis",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
        "bedrock:ListInferenceProfiles",
        "bedrock:ListTagsForResource",
        "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
        "servicequotas:GetServiceQuota"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**What this allows:**
- `sts:GetCallerIdentity` - Get your AWS account ID
- `bedrock:ListInferenceProfiles` - Discover inference profiles for selected models
- `bedrock:ListTagsForResource` - Retrieve tags for inference profiles (for metadata display)
- `cloudwatch:GetMetricData` - Fetch CloudWatch metrics for token usage (TPM, RPM, TPD, throttles)
- `servicequotas:GetServiceQuota` - Retrieve service quota limits for visualization

**Note:** This option assumes you already have metadata files (`metadata/fm-list-*.yml`)

#### Option 2: Full Feature Access (Complete)

**Use this if:** You run metadata refresh scripts (`./scripts/refresh-*.sh`) or test data generators.

This includes **all permissions from Option 1** plus additional permissions:

Note: You need to replace some part with your own account ID and the region used.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "BedrockUsageAnalysis",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
        "bedrock:ListInferenceProfiles",
        "bedrock:ListTagsForResource",
        "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
        "servicequotas:GetServiceQuota"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "MetadataManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "account:ListRegions",
        "bedrock:ListFoundationModels",
        "servicequotas:ListServiceQuotas"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "QuotaMappingWithLLM",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:InvokeModel"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:bedrock:your-current-region::foundation-model/anthropic.claude-*",
        "arn:aws:bedrock:your-current-region:your-current-account:inference-profile/*",
        "arn:aws:bedrock:your-current-region:your-current-account:application-inference-profile/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "TestDataGeneration",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:CreateInferenceProfile"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:bedrock:your-current-region:your-current-account:application-inference-profile/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Additional permissions explained:**
- `account:ListRegions` - List enabled AWS regions (for `refresh-regions.sh`)
- `bedrock:ListFoundationModels` - List all foundation models (for `refresh-fm-list.sh`)
- `servicequotas:ListServiceQuotas` - List all Bedrock quotas (for `refresh-fm-quotas-mapping.sh` and `refresh-quota-index.sh`)
- `bedrock:InvokeModel` - Invoke Claude models for intelligent quota mapping (for `refresh-fm-quotas-mapping.sh` only, restricted to Claude models)
- `bedrock:CreateInferenceProfile` - Create application inference profiles for testing (for `generate-test-data.sh` and `stress-test.sh` only)

#### Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Use Option 1 if you don't need to refresh metadata
2. **Resource Restrictions**: The `bedrock:InvokeModel` permission is limited to Claude models only
3. **No Write Permissions**: All permissions are read-only except for model invocation
4. **Region Scoping**: Consider adding `Condition` blocks to restrict to specific regions if needed

Example with region restriction:
```json
{
  "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
      "aws:RequestedRegion": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ Setup Guide

### Step 1: Clone and Set Up Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd analyze-bedrock-usage-and-quotas

# The scripts will automatically create a virtual environment
# and install dependencies when first run
```

### Step 2: Configure AWS Credentials

Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with credentials that have the required permissions to the right AWS account. Please refer to [this documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html). Then performt he following command to verify.

```bash
# Verify your AWS identity
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### Step 3: Refresh Foundation Model Lists (Optional)

Before analyzing usage, you may want to refresh the foundation model lists:

```bash
# Refresh regions list
./scripts/refresh-regions.sh

# Refresh foundation models for all regions
./scripts/refresh-fm-list.sh

# Or refresh for a specific region
./scripts/refresh-fm-list.sh us-west-2
```

This step is optional because this repository comes with preloaded metadata that contains these information. However, you might want to refresh those metadata since new regions, new foundation models, or new quotas for the FMs might have come since this repository was refreshed.

### Step 4: Run Usage Analysis

```bash
# Launch the interactive usage analyzer
./analyze-bedrock-usage.sh
```

The script will prompt you to:
1. **Select AWS region** - Choose the region where you have Bedrock usage
2. **Select granularity** - Choose the time granularity to aggregate usage across (e.g. 1 min, 5 mins, 1 hour)
2. **Select model provider** - Filter by provider (Amazon, Anthropic, etc.)
3. **Select model** - Choose the specific model to analyze
4. **Select inference profile** (if applicable) - Choose base model or cross-region profile

### Step 5: View Results

After analysis completes, find your results in the `results/` directory:

```bash
# List generated reports
ls -lh results/

# Open HTML report in browser (macOS)
open results/<model-name>-<timestamp>.html

# Open HTML report in browser (Linux)
xdg-open results/<model-name>-<timestamp>.html

# View JSON data
cat results/<model-name>-<timestamp>.json | jq
```

## 📖 Understanding the Results

### HTML Report Structure

The HTML report contains several sections:

**1. Quota Limits Section** (if available)
- Shows TPM, RPM, and TPD quota limits for your model (if applicable)
- Displayed at the top for quick reference

**2. Statistics Table**
- One colum per time period (1hour, 1day, 7days, 14days, 30days)
- Columns: Metric Type, p50, p90, Average, Total, Data Points
- Metrics: TPM, RPM, TPD, InvocationThrottles, Invocations, InvocationServerErrors, InvocationClientErrors, InvocationLatency, InputTokenCount, and OutputTokenCount

**3. Charts**
- Time series graphs for each metric and time period
- **Red dashed lines**: Quota limits (when available)
- **Colored lines**: Model usage over time
- Hover over points to see exact values
- The chart can have multiple lines showing the aggregated (total) usage for that metric and the individual application inference profile usage 

### Interpreting the Data

**Token Usage Patterns:**
- **p50 (median)**: Typical usage - 50% of time periods are below this
- **p90**: High usage - only 10% of time periods exceed this
- **Average**: Mean value across all data points
- **Total**: Sum of all values in the period

**Quota Comparison:**
- If lines approach or cross red dashed quota lines, you may hit limits
- Consistent p90 near quota suggests you need a quota increase
- Large gap between p50 and quota indicates headroom
- IMPORTANT: Please cross-check the quota with ones from AWS service quotas manually, since the large language model-mapped quotas might not be always accurate.

**Throttles:**
- Any non-zero throttle count indicates you've hit rate limits
- Check which time periods show throttles to identify peak usage times

### JSON Output Structure

  }
}
```

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Quota Mapping

The tool can automatically map AWS Service Quotas to foundation models:

```bash
# Run the quota mapping tool
./scripts/refresh-fm-quotas-mapping.sh
```

This will:
1. Prompt you to select a Bedrock API region
2. Prompt you to select a Claude model for intelligent mapping
3. Process ALL regions automatically
4. Use the model in Bedrock to identify quota codes (TPM/RPM/TPD) intelligently
5. Cache L-codes (same across regions) for efficiency
6. Update `metadata/fm-list-{region}.yml` files with quota mappings

**How it works:**
- Uses Bedrock foundation model to extract base model family names (e.g., "nova-lite" → "nova")
- Matches quota names containing model family + endpoint type
- Recognizes "on-demand", "cross-region", and "global" quota patterns
- Only makes 2-3 inference calls per model profile (on-demand, cross-region, global)
- Caches results to avoid redundant API calls

### Metadata Management

**Foundation Model Lists** (`metadata/fm-list-{region}.yml`):
```yaml
models:
- model_id: anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0
  provider: Anthropic
  inference_types: [ON_DEMAND, INFERENCE_PROFILE]
  inference_profiles: [us, eu, global]
  endpoints:
    base:
      quotas: {tpm: L-12345, rpm: L-67890, tpd: null}
    us:
      quotas: {tpm: L-ABCDE, rpm: L-FGHIJ, tpd: null}
    global:
      quotas: {tpm: L-KLMNO, rpm: L-PQRST, tpd: null}
```

**Regions List** (`metadata/regions.yml`):
```yaml
regions:
  - us-east-1
  - us-west-2
  - eu-west-1
  ...
```

### Customizing Analysis

The analyzer supports various customization options through the interactive prompts:

**Model Selection:**
- Filter by provider to narrow down choices
- Select specific model variants
- Choose inference profiles (base, us, eu, jp, au, apac, global)

**Time Periods:**
- 1hour: Recent short-term patterns
- 1day: Daily patterns
- 7days: Weekly trends
- 14days: Bi-weekly patterns
- 30days: Monthly trends

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Analysis Issues

**Q: "No metrics found" error**
A: This means CloudWatch has no data for the selected model. Verify:
1. The model has been used in the selected region
2. You're checking the correct time period
3. CloudWatch metrics are enabled for Bedrock

**Q: Quota limits not showing in report**
A: Quotas are only shown if they've been mapped. Run:
```bash
./scripts/refresh-fm-quotas-mapping.sh
```
Then re-run the analysis.

**Q: "Model not found" error**
A: Refresh your foundation model lists:
```bash
./scripts/refresh-fm-list.sh
```

### Quota Mapping Issues

**Q: Quota mapping fails with "ValidationException"**
A: Ensure:
1. The selected Bedrock region supports the chosen model
2. You have access to the Claude model you selected
3. The model ID is correct (check for typos)

**Q: Some models show no quota mappings**
A: This can happen if:
1. The model is new and quotas haven't been created yet
2. The model name doesn't match quota naming patterns
3. The foundation model couldn't identify matching quotas

### Permission Issues

**Q: "AccessDenied" errors**
A: Verify your IAM permissions. See the [IAM Permissions](#iam-permissions) section for detailed permission requirements. Use:
- **Option 1** if you only run `./analyze-bedrock-usage.sh`
- **Option 2** if you also run metadata refresh scripts

### Performance Issues

**Q: Analysis is very slow**
A: CloudWatch queries can take time for large time ranges. To speed up:
1. Analyze shorter time periods
2. Use specific models instead of analyzing all models
3. Check your network connection to AWS

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Credentials**: Never commit AWS credentials to the repository
- **Quota Data**: Quota information is fetched from AWS and not hardcoded
- **API Calls**: All Bedrock API calls use your AWS credentials
- **Data Storage**: All data is stored locally in `metadata/` and `results/`
